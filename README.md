# VueBlog
this is to be a Vue/Django project that hosts a blog where i hope to detail some of work outside of work (mostly my graduate work in statistics). This is modeled on a tutorial - https://realpython.com/python-django-blog.
By day I work with a MERNish stack and I use Python primarily for Data Analysis so I'm excited to learn and grow my knowledge of both Vue and Django.
